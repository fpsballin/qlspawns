Top down views of maps for the game Quake Live, with numbered circles indicating respawn points.

The logic for where a player can respawn is roughly "the furthest 50% of spawns away from currently living players".

The mouse cursor is the location of a living player, and additional living players can be placed as pink circles by clicking. Given the location of the mouse cursor and any other pink circles placed on the map, the green circles should show possible spawns (furthest 50%) while the red circles are spawns that are blocked from happening (nearest 50%).
